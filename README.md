# Lottery-DApp-Blockhain
## INTRODUCTION
Lottery is one of the preferred entertaining choice of many people.
On average, every single second person in developed countries habitually participates in lotteries.
Lottery players doubt the fairness of lotteries and ask the following questions:
Are the deal and ticket real or not?
Is the random number generation (RNG) method secure and random?
Are the prizes paid on time?
Is the jackpot winner real?
In blockchain, since no centralized authority is there to govern the game, there will be no concerns related to winnings. 
Player’s funds directly go into the contract without the interference of intermediaries.
All records are stored on the blockchain, players can have a transparent and traceable view of the saved transactions. 
Due to the traceability offered by the platform, they can reach to the roots of disputes if any occurs in the future.
Distribution of funds issue in lotteries is solved by Blockchain
 Write-forward authentication system that can add with no risks. 
Since every node has a copy of the ledger, there is no way fraud can be put through.
## MOTIVATION
DApps are very different from a classical web app.
Web app runs on a centralized server, and whenever a client requests for information, it receives the requested information from the server.
 In addition, a centralized authority controls a web app, and if the server goes down, the web app will come to a halt. 
Web apps are more prone to cyber-attacks
Other hand, DApps function in a decentralized environment.
Some of the Dapps characteristics are –
Decentralized that makes them independent, and no one controls them.
Deterministic i.e., they perform the same function irrespective of the environment they are executed.
Turing compatible, which means given the required resources, the DApps can perform any action.
Isolated, executed in a virtual environment known as EVM 
if the smart contract happens to have a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network.
## ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

Following are some important tools which will be used in this project which are relevant tools required for developing a simple dApp. 
#### 1. Smart Contract Programming Languages
Solidity
Currently, Solidity is the preferred/most used language used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum platform.
#### 2. Development frameworks
Truffle
Truffle is a development environment and testing framework that makes building Ethereum Dapps easier and provides you the necessary nuggets for smart contracts manipulation.
#### 3. Development Blockchains
Ganache
Part of the truffle suite family, ganache allows you to quickly run a development blockchain on your local machine.
#### 4. dApp Browsers
##### Metamask 
Metamask is a crypto wallet that allows you to run Ethereum dApps in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. 
##### Web3
It talks to the Ethereum Blockchain with JSON RPC, which stands for "Remote Procedure Call" protocol.

## CONCLUSION
Blockchain keeps records of everything that is done on it and this makes it possible whether it’s jackpot wins, investments, ticket sales, and others to be transparent and fair to all parties included. 
Hacking attacks become quite impossible, as a hacker has to manipulate every single block to change the lottery numbers.
Blockchain lotteries are the perfect solution for a fun gambling ecosystem.
